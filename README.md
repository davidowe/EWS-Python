A minimal Expected Work Search example implementation.
By Owen Randall (davidowe@ualberta.ca).

From the IJCAI 2024 paper:
Expected Work Search: Combining Win Rate and Proof Size Estimation
Owen Randall, Martin M Ìˆuller, Ting-Han Wei, Ryan Hayward

Run using the command: python EWS.py
Uses a Go Text Protocol command line interface.
Lists known commands on startup.

Can solve up to the 3x3 Go board and 4x4 Hex board in a reasonable timeframe.
Does not include any improvements for a strong search, this is just a barebones implementation of EWS.
